# EVS Senior Design Project (2018-2019)

#This repo contains the Arduino scripts for the temperature, light intensity, pressure, and humidity sensor.
#These scripts are integrated as functions in the state machine for the node. In order to compile the code for the
#state machine, the RadioHead repo must be downloaded and imported.
